Custom code used on my weather station. 

The weather station it self is using Wordpress and Weather Station Plugin. 
This repository is for my custom code, both SQL in the MySQL database, bash-scripts used for transferring data to twitter, facebook, etc and also handling web camera photos and timelapse
